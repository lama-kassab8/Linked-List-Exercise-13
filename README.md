#  LeetCode Exercise: Swap Nodes in Pairs

## Problem  
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.  
You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the listâ€™s nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed).

### Example  
**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,4]`  
**Output:** `[2,1,4,3]`


##  What I Did  
- Implemented a solution using **iteration** and a **dummy node** to simplify edge cases.  
- Practiced pointer manipulation to swap nodes without changing values.  
- Handled edge cases like empty list and single-node list.


##  Key Concepts Learned  
- Using a dummy node to simplify operations at the head.  
- Navigating and modifying singly linked lists.  
- Understanding the importance of `prev`, `first`, and `second` pointers during node swapping.
